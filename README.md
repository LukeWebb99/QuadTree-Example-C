# QuadTree-Example-C

Part 3 of 3 examples of a working Quadtree using C++ & SFML, this exmaple is basic showing random points plotted on the window then being sorted into the tree then using a query
we can now test for collisions as the random points randomly walk around, this will be shown by highlighting the points white.
